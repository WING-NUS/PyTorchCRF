# PyTorchCRF

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WING-NUS/PyTorchCRF.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WING-NUS/PyTorchCRF)

PyTorchCRF is an implementation of Conditional Random Field using the PyTorch library

This is a work-in-progress repository to develop a stand-alone lightweight CRF Layer in PyTorch. The base code is factored out of [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) library's CRF implementation.

We aren't using AllenNLP since we find it to be bloated and hence cumbersome to install due to the innumerable dependencies it come with as of October, 2018.

## Installation

You can use `pip` to install this module.
