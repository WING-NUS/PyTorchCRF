PyTorch is an implementaion of Conditional Random Field using the PyTorch library

This is a work-in-progress repository to develop a stand-alone lightweight CRF Layer in Pytorch. The base code is factored out of [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) library's CRF implementation. 

We aren't using AllenNLP since we find it to be bloated and hence cumbersome to install due to the innumerable dependencies it come with as of October, 2018.
